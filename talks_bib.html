  abstract = {Scanpaths, sequences of fixations of the eyes, have historically played an important role in eyetracking research but their use has remained highly limited until recently. Here, we summarize earlier research and argue that scanpaths are a valuable source of information for reading research, specifically in the study of sentence comprehension. We also discuss a freely available, open source scanpath analysis method that we used to evaluate theoretical claims about human parsing and about how the parser guides the eyes during reading. This scanpath analysis is shown to yield new information that was missed when traditional approaches were used to study theories about eye guidance during garden-pathing. We also show how relatively subtle scanpath effects can be detected when we report the scanpath analysis of a large eyetracking corpus. In sum, we argue that scanpath analyses are likely to serve as an increasingly important tool in reading research, and perhaps also in other areas where eyetracking is used, e.g., in studies using the visual world paradigm.}

  abstract = {Pioneering work in reading research has shown that scanpaths in reading can be informative about sentences processing (Frazier, Rayner, 1982). Nevertheless, scanpaths have not gained much traction in reading research. One reason for that may have been a lack of suitable analytical tools. Here, we summarize three recent studies in which we used a new scanpath measure to analyze gaze data from two experimental studies (von der Malsburg, Vasishth, 2011, 2012) and one corpus study (von der Malsburg, Kliegl, Vasishth, under revision). The experiments investigated how readers process temporarily ambiguous sentences. We showed that readers do not always commit to one of the alternative interpretations, and that readers with low working-memory capacity do so less often. Contrary to what was reported earlier, we found that reparsing instead of targeted repair is a common strategy to recover from incorrect interpretations. Interestingly, these results did not emerge in an analysis using traditional word-based eyetracking measures showing their limitations. In the corpus study, we demonstrated how syntax, oculomotor constraints, and age of reader jointly determine the regularity of scanpaths. We argue that, taken together, these results establish the scanpath as an informative and tractable object of investigation in reading research.},

  abstract = {Recent studies (Dimigen et al., JEP:G, 2011; Kretzschmar et al., NeuroReport, 2009) demonstrated the feasibility of investigating fixation-related potentials (FRPs) and that the results are similar to brain potentials recorded during rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP). We conducted an experiment to assess if this correspondence also holds for rhythmic brain activity. To pit our results against ults gained with RSVP, the experiment used sentences that are known to produce reliable effects both in the time domain and in the frequency domain (Hagoort, Science, 2004). Participants (N=48) read freely through true ('The Thames flows through London') and false statements ('The Hudson flows through London'). Hagoort et al. report an N400, a negative-going deflection in the ERP with a peak around 400 ms, as well as increased theta (4-7 Hz) and gamma (30-70 Hz) activity. During our experiment, participants' eye movements were monitored and their EEG was recorded from 32 electrodes and later evaluated contingent to the first fixation on the critical word. We analyzed the canonical eye-tracking measures with linear mixed-effects models and the EEG with cluster-permutation tests (Maris \& Oostenveld, J Neurosci Methods, 2007) to control for multiple comparisons. As expected, we observed a negativity in the FRP with a centro-parietal distribution and a peak latency of approximately 400 ms. Also as expected, this N400 lined up with increased first fixation durations, gaze durations, and regression rates in the eye movement record (Dambacher \& Kliegl, Brain Res, 2007). Crucially, fixation-related power spectra showed synchronization in the delta range (1-3 Hz) at central electrodes and desynchronization in the upper alpha range (11-13 Hz) at occipito-parietal sites relative to a pre-fixation baseline. None of these effects is reported by Hagoort et al. which suggests that fixation-related EEG changes are at least not fully comparable to those observed in RSVP. One reason for the diverging results could lie in different processing demands: In RSVP, readers must retrieve earlier parts of the sentence from working memory because they cannot make regressions. Increased theta activity reflects this more effortful memory access (Klimesch, Brain Res Rev, 1999). In natural reading, readers can easily move their eyes back to resolve the processing difficulty which facilitates memory access. Our findings question the comparability of results acquired with serial presentation vs. natural reading.}

  abstract = {The role of goal has largely been ignored in sentence processing research, presumably because (morpho-)syntactic processing is assumed to be invariant to goal, which is not necessarily true. In a series of four single-trial self-paced reading experiments manipulating task and sentence grammaticality, we show that: 1) in grammatical sentences like 1a and 1b, no effect is observed at the verb when participants expect to answer comprehension questions, but a slowdown in condition 1b (attraction effect) arises when participants expect to judge acceptability; 2) in ungrammatical sentences like 1c and 1d, agreement attraction (speedup at the verb+1 in 1d) is present irrespective of the task, but the effect changes direction at the verb+2 when participants expect to judge sentence acceptability. Typically-observed reading time effects (attraction in 1c vs. 1d, no effect in 1a vs. 1b) occur when the goal is answering comprehension questions but disappear when the goal is acceptability judgment. Instead, judgment-typical effects appear. Overall, agreement attraction demonstrates a surprising degree of task-dependency.  1. (a) The candidate that the lobbyist openly supports ...
