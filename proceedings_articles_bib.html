  abstract = {Scanpaths, sequences of fixations of the eyes, have historically played an important role in eyetracking research but their use has remained highly limited until recently. Here, we summarize earlier research and argue that scanpaths are a valuable source of information for reading research, specifically in the study of sentence comprehension. We also discuss a freely available, open source scanpath analysis method that we used to evaluate theoretical claims about human parsing and about how the parser guides the eyes during reading. This scanpath analysis is shown to yield new information that was missed when traditional approaches were used to study theories about eye guidance during garden-pathing. We also show how relatively subtle scanpath effects can be detected when we report the scanpath analysis of a large eyetracking corpus. In sum, we argue that scanpath analyses are likely to serve as an increasingly important tool in reading research, and perhaps also in other areas where eyetracking is used, e.g., in studies using the visual world paradigm.}

Das Dual- Mechanism-Modell (DMM; Pinker \& Prince, 1988; Clahsen, 1999) nimmt an, dass reguläre und irreguläre Formen von zwei verschiedenen Mechanismen verarbeitet werden. Vertreter des Single-Mechanism Ansatzes gehen alternativ von einem einzigen Mechanismus aus, der sowohl der Verarbeitung von regulären als auch irregulären Verben dient.}

  abstract = {The principle of dependency length minimization, which seeks to keep syntactically related words close in a sentence, is thought to universally shape the structure of human languages for effective communication. However, the extent to which dependency length minimization is applied in human language systems is not yet fully understood. Preverbally, the placement of long-before-short constituents and post-verbally, short-before-long constituents are known to minimize overall dependency length of a sentence. In this study, we test the hypothesis that placing only the shortest preverbal constituent next to the main-verb explains word order preferences in Hindi (a SOV language) as opposed to the global minimization of dependency length.  We characterize this approach as a least-effort strategy because it is a cost-effective way to shorten all dependencies between the verb and its preverbal dependencies. As such, this approach is consistent with the bounded-rationality perspective according to which decision making is governed by `fast but frugal’ heuristics rather than by a search for optimal solutions. Consistent with this idea, our results indicate that actual corpus sentences in the Hindi-Urdu Treebank corpus are better explained by the least effort strategy than by global minimization of dependency lengths. Additionally, for the task of distinguishing corpus sentences from counterfactual variants, we find that the dependency length and constituent length of the constituent closest to the main verb is a much better predictor of whether a sentence appeared in the corpus than total dependency length. Overall, our work sheds light on the role of cognitive resource constraints in shaping natural languages.}

  abstract = {Some German adjective-compound-noun constructions (‘severe storm.warning’) exhibit a bracketing paradox where an adjective semantically modifies the first noun N1 instead of the grammatically required last noun N2 thus violating compositionality. We present two experiments that examined the interpretation of nominal compounds and bracketing paradoxes. Experiment 1 showed that the semantic match of N1 and the adjective has a significant impact on the acceptability of Adj-N1N2 constructions. Experiment 2 probed the participants’ adjective attachment choices as well as the relationship between and attachment and acceptability: While N2 attachments were most common, many constructions received mixed and some consistently bracketing paradox interpretations. High ratings for Adj-N2 were predictive of N2 attachment, but high Adj-N1 ratings led to bracketing paradox interpretations. These results are partially against grammatical expectations and suggest competition between the nouns for modification, likely due to semantic and/or pragmatic factors.}
