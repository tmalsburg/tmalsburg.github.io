<h2 id="org78f5f65">FAQ</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org78f5f65">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Is the PhD in a structured program and is there required coursework?</b><br>
The PhD is not in a structured program and the position is primarily focused on conducting research.  There is no required course work, but you may be encouraged to take a small number of courses that provide you with training relevant to your project (e.g. eye-tracking, statistics).<br></li>
<li><b>Can I apply if I haven't finished my Master’s degree yet?</b><br>
You are invited to apply if your thesis is well underway and you expect to finish soon.  However, the degree is strictly required by the time the contract starts.<br></li>
<li><b>Are my research interests close enough to the research focus of your group?</b><br>
Feel free to ask me, but if you have doubts, chances are that our overlap is too small.  A good match will be crucial for the success of your PhD project.<br></li>
<li><b>You write that the group’s research interests include sentence processing in under-researched languages.  What do you mean by that specifically?</b>  It basically means that the PhD project can be on a language other than English, but it doesn’t have to be.  Of course, it will be helpful if the language is one for which your advisor has expertise and for which study participants can be found locally.<br></li>
<li><b>Will you make a decision before the application deadline?</b><br>
All applications received by the deadline will receive full consideration – there's no need to rush.<br></li>
</ul>
