  abstract = {Standard analyses of eye movements in reading test a set of canonical dependent measures calculated for multiple regions.  Although the resulting multiple comparisons increase the rate of false positive results, it is accepted standard practice not to correct for that.  We investigated false positives rates through computer simulations and tested how much statistical power has to be sacrificed to control them.  In 100.000 iterations, we generated six realistic data sets of eye movements for a hypothetical experiment with typical parameters.  The true effect sizes of the manipulation ranged from 0 ms to 40 ms.  Four standard measures were analyzed using linear mixed models: first fixation duration, gaze duration, go-past time, and total viewing time.  In the data sets with no true effect, the rate of false positives was 12.1\%, i.e. much higher than the conventionally accepted 5\%.  A Bonferroni correction reduced false positives to 3.2\% and was therefore slightly more conservative than required.  The reduction in power due to the Bonferroni correction was moderate, e.g., from 90\% to 75\% for effect sizes of 5 ms.  Contrary to conventional wisdom, the Bonferroni correction seems to be an appropriate tool for controlling false positives in reading experiments.},

  abstract = {Recent research demonstrated the feasibility of analyzing fixation-related brain potentials (FRPs) recorded during natural reading (Kretzschmar et al., 2009; Dimigen et al., 2011). Two questions arise from these studies: (1) Are effects observed with fixation-triggered EEG signals comparable to those observed in standard RSVP designs? (2) Does the combined analysis of EEG and fixation data provide additional insights into reading and comprehension processes that are not available with either method alone? Both above-mentioned studies used material known to robustly elicit strong N400 effects. The present study (N=50) examined responses to a more subtle manipulation representative of common experimental designs: we manipulated the distance between anaphoric expressions (pronouns, verb ellipsis) and their antecedents. Differences were examined using a non-parametric Monte Carlo test (Maris \& Oostenveld, 2007). Increased distance of the antecedent elicited an early frontocentral negativity in response to verb ellipses (88ms-134ms, p<0.001) and a negativity at frontocentral and parietal electrodes on the words following pronouns (98ms-186ms, p<0.001). We discuss these results in the context of earlier findings and argue that adopting FRP-methodology requires factoring in complex visuomotor contingencies that are not yet fully understood and that evoke ERP effects different from those seen in RSVP designs.},
