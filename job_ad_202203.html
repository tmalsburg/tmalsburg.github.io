<h1 class="title">PhD or postdoc position in experimental and/or computational psycholinguistics, 3-years, no teaching obligation</h1>
</header><p>
The research group for <b>Psycholinguistics and Cognitive Modeling</b> at <a href="https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/en/">University of Stuttgart</a> is seeking to hire a doctoral or postdoctoral researcher.  The successful candidate will conduct research on a topic of their choice related to language comprehension broadly defined.  The research group emphasizes research methods, particularly eye-tracking and large-scale online experiments, Bayesian data-analytic methods, cognitive models of language processing, and similar.  We do not expect applicants to be experts on any of these methods, but a demonstrated interest in a subset of these methods is a big plus.  We provide structured training in all of these areas.  So this position is a great opportunity for you to improve your methods skills.<br>
</p>

<p>
There is <b>no teaching obligation</b>, but the opportunity to teach is available if desired (topic and format largely free).  The successful candidate will assist in the management of the lab.  Postdocs will occasionally supervise BA or MA theses.<br>
</p>

<p>
English is our standard language.  Solid spoken and written English skills are therefore required.  Knowledge of German is not needed.<br>
</p>

<p>
The position is remunerated according to pay-grade E13 of the German collective agreement for the public service (TV-L).  Postdocs will be offered a 100% contract, PhD students will be offered a 75% contract (which is still pretty decent and includes health insurance and other benefits).  In addition, the lab provides funding for participation in workshops and conferences and a budged for childcare during conference travel.<br>
</p>

<p>
The <b>start date is flexible but preferably October 2022 or earlier</b>.  The PhD position can be extended by one year.<br>

University of Stuttgart is one of the oldest and most renowned technical universities in Germany.  The research group for Psycholinguistics and Cognitive Modeling is directed by <a href="index.html">Titus von der Malsburg</a> and is part of the <a href="https://www.ling.uni-stuttgart.de/en/">Institute of Linguistics</a>.  Our lab has multiple eye-trackers (1 × TrackPixx3, 1 × SMI iView X, and 3 × GazePoint GP3) and access to high-performance computing infrastructure.  Access to an EEG/co-registration lab (ANT Neuro, EyeLink 1000+) is possible through a partner at the university.<br>
</p>

<p>
One theme we care deeply about is <b>open, robust, replicable, sustainable, and efficient science</b>, and we are actively working to improve the workflows, practices, and software tools that support it.  The lab is <b>family friendly</b> and we strive to foster a vibrant and friendly community while respecting and accommodating personal constraints.<br>
