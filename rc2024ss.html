<b>Time:</b> Thursday, 15:45 &#x2013; 17:15<br>
<b>Place:</b> K2, M 11.01, conference room on the roof of the building.  Take the elevator to the 10th floor, then the staircase on the right-hand side to the top floor.<br>
</p>

<p>
<b>Content:</b> This course consists of two parts: In one stream, we will welcome guest lecturers who will present their latest research in the area of incremental language comprehension (or some closely related topic).  In the second stream, students will develop a proposal for their own experimental research study and we will provide you with short lectures on and demonstrations of the tools of the trade.  These proposals could then later be implemented as MA thesis projects (but that decision is completely independent from this course).  We will alternate between these two streams from week to week.<br>
</p>

<p>
<b>Forum:</b> Students are invited to use the <a href="https://ilias3.uni-stuttgart.de/goto_Uni_Stuttgart_frm_3711527.html">course forum on Ilias</a> to ask questions and to discuss.<br>

<b>Title:</b> Can we close the eye-movement gap in reading research by using lower sampling rates?<br>
</p>

<p>
<b>Abstract:</b> Eye-movement research has revolutionized our understanding of reading, but the use of eye-tracking techniques is still limited to only a few countries in the world. Publication statistics from the last 25 years show that most publications on eye-movements during reading have authors based in Western countries. We argue that eye-tracking is the ideal technique for reading and language research in countries with limited resources, and that it is crucially important to not just study a small subset of languages, but that more needs to be done to make eye-tracking technology accessible for researchers in those countries. This includes evaluating to what extent cognitive processes during reading can be measured with less expensive eye-tracking devices. One such way may be to use devices with a lower sampling rate, which may be much less expensive than high-sampling rate eye-trackers. We present findings from a study that recorded readers’ eye movements during reading at different sampling rates. We show that it is possible to measure the classic effect of word frequency on fixation duration, reflecting ongoing processing during reading, even at sampling rates of 250 Hz and less.<br>

<b>Title, Hahn:</b> A Model of Language Processing as Resource-Rational Sequence Prediction<br>
</p>

<p>
<b>Abstract:</b> Psycholinguists have long studied humans’ difficulty in comprehending complex sentences as a window into the nature of human language processing.  Prominent theoretical accounts assign central roles either to expectations about upcoming content, or to retrieval of past content from short-term memory.  Each account is supported by a substantial body of evidence, and unifying them has proven challenging.  We propose a unifying model based on resource-rational memory representations, which we scale to the rich statistical structure of language using large-scale text data and contemporary machine learning methods.  The model makes fine-grained predictions sharply different from those of existing models, which we confirm in three behavioral experiments.  Taken together, our work shows how general cognitive principles, implemented using machine learning, predict fine-grained patterns in human language comprehension that previous theories cannot account for.<br>

<b>Bio:</b> Michael Hahn is an Assistant Professor at Saarland University, Germany. He received his PhD from Stanford University in 2022. His research aims to uncover the computational principles underlying language processing, and their implications for Natural Language Processing. To this end, he combines behavioral experiments with information theory and contemporary machine learning. His research has been published in journals including PNAS, Psychological Review, and Cognition.<br>
