  abstract = {Existing corpus-based measures of morphological productivity all exhibit problematic dependences on sample size. Here, we show that another measure, the Shannon entropy of a type frequency distribution, has a different relationship with sample size, one that allows meaningful analysis in a wider range of circumstances. Once the sample gets large enough, entropy stabilises at interpretable values. In contrast to the existing measures, this behaviour allows the entropy scores of samples of different sizes to be sensibly compared. Entropy's stabilisation is due to an intriguing property of type frequency distributions, namely their self-similarity: even when sample size changes, the shape of the distribution itself does not. We also include empirical comparisons of entropy to three standard productivity measures—type count, potential productivity, and S—and provide a tentative conceptual validation of entropy as a productivity measure, showing with a Bayesian regression model that entropy picks up on important aspects of what it means for a morpheme to be productive.}

  title = {The Role of Conversational Principles in Cognitive Biases: {The} Case of Overprecision in Interval Estimation},
  year = {2024},
  tags = {manuscript},
  abstract = {Conversational principles such as Grice's maxim of Quantity (roughly: be informative) are essential to our ability to communicate efficiently. Due to their ubiquitous nature in language-based communication, they may interfere in a large variety of other cognitive tasks which at first glance may not seem linguistic in nature. Here, we report three experiments that investigated the role of the Quantity maxim in the overconfidence bias in interval estimation (also referred to as overprecision). Experiment 1 (N=309) used a chat paradigm to bias participants against providing the most informative answer, as would be required by Quantity, resulting in a reduced overprecision bias. Experiment 2 (N=322) and Experiment 3 (N=309) tested whether this effect depends on explicit social cues, specifically, the presence of a conversational partner. Both experiments replicated Experiment 1 in the absence of a full conversational context, thus showing that linguistic cues alone are sufficient. Taken together, these results suggest that conversational principles – extensively studied in linguistics, but largely ignored in research on cognitive biases – play an important role in the overprecision bias and, as we argue, likely in other biases as well.}

  url = {https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/sb2z8},
  abstract = {Purpose: Recent research on the use of eye movements to predict performance on reading comprehension tasks suggests that while eye movements may be used to measure comprehension, the relationship between eye-movement behaviour and comprehension is influenced by differences in task demands between comprehension measures. In this study, we examined the usefulness of eye movements collected during reading with no additional task demands (a ‘read-only’ condition) to predict comprehension ability as measured by a recall task. Method: We collected eye-movement behaviour from adult native speakers of English (N = 62, 46 females, mean age 26 years) while they read nine passages of fictional text in two conditions: a read-only condition with no additional task, and a recall condition where participants were asked the recall the story after reading it. We ran Bayesian logistic regression models to predict performance on the recall tasks from standard eye-tracking measures collected during the two reading conditions (read-only and recall). Results: Eye-tracking measures collected in the read-only and recall conditions were both useful in predicting reading comprehension as measured by recall scores. Additionally, the relationship between eye-movement behaviour and recall performance was similar for both reading conditions. In both cases, a combination of early and late measures were the best predictors of performance on the recall task. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate the usefulness of eye movements collected during reading with no additional task as predictors of reading comprehension ability.}
