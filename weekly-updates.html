</header><p>
Here’s a quick write-up of how we do weekly updates in my lab (and how we did it in Shravan Vasishth’s lab when I replaced him 2016–2018):<br>
</p>
<div id="outline-container-org28d3b54" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org28d3b54">How we do it:</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org28d3b54">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We send weekly updates first thing on Monday.  We then discuss individual items in our weekly meeting as needed.<br></li>

<li>We send weekly updates to each other via e-mail.  Subject line is <code>Weekly updates</code> so that historical updates are easy to find.<br></li>

<li>The updates list things that we’ve been working on since the last update.  Keywords and/or short sentences in bullet-point style are enough.  The report should be concise and yet specific.  For instance, “worked on project XYZ” is too vague, instead say what exactly you were doing, e.g.: “Wrote and submitted preregistration report for XYZ project.”<br></li>

<li>We optionally list ongoing tasks even if we didn’t make progress on them, e.g: “XYZ manuscript needs revision, waiting for data of replication.”<br></li>

<li>We also list things that we are planning to work on in the next week, but only major items and in broad strokes.<br></li>

<li>If you are stuck with something and need input, you can mention this as well, e.g: “LMMs for XYZ analysis don’t converge.  Do I have to reimplement in Stan?”<br></li>
</ul>

<p>
In the weekly meeting, we will quickly go through these updates and discuss where necessary.  The updates therefore also serve as a (partial) agenda for the meeting.<br>
</p>

<p>
Writing the updates shouldn’t take more than 10 min and going through the updates in the weekly meeting can take as little as 1 min when there's nothing to discuss.<br>

<h2 id="orgd226e2f">Why are we doing weekly updates?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd226e2f">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Everyone gets an idea of what the other lab members are working on.  This creates cohesion and common ground and may inspire new ideas and collaborations.<br></li>

<li>It gives people an opportunity to get quick input on smaller issues from the whole lab without having to schedule a dedicated lab meeting and without going through the mailing list.  Many things can be solved much faster with everyone in a room.<br></li>

<li>Weekly updates are easier than monthly or bi-monthly updates, because it’s easier to remember what you were doing in the last week.  From the top of my head, I have no idea what I was doing one or two months ago.  Effectively, the psychological barrier to writing weekly reports is much lower.<br></li>

<li>Writing weekly reports helps us track our progress and reflect on how we spend our time.  Comparing what we wanted to accomplish in a week with what we actually accomplished can surprise us – positively or negatively – and reflecting on it will help us make more realistic plans in the future.<br></li>

<h2 id="org623940c">How to write your updates effectively:</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org623940c">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Start by going through your updates from the previous week to refresh your memory.<br></li>

<li>If you’re using a software for to-do management, writing the report basically comes down to copying the list of ticked-off tasks and editing it lightly.<br></li>

<li>Remembering everything that happened in a week can be difficult.  The following strategies can help:<br>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Check your calendar.<br></li>
<li>Quickly review your e-mails (sent and received) for the last week.  In my e-mail client, I created a virtual folder for this.<br></li>
<li>Inspect the list of files that changed in your relevant folders over the last 8 days.  On Linux (and OSX?), this command that shows all files in the <code>Documents</code> and <code>Dropbox</code> folders that have changed in the last 8 days: <code>find ~/Documents ~/Dropbox/ -mtime -8</code>.<br></li>
</ul></li>

<li>Add tasks that are on hold and things you’d like to get done in the coming week.  Done!<br></li>
</ol>

<p>
For those who are not yet using a to-do manager of some sort, it's highly recommended.  Most people eventually develop their own approach to managing to-dos but an excellent starting point is the Getting Things Done method (GTD) by David Allen.<br>
